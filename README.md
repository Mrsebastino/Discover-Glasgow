### Features
 In this project, i used a navbar from Bootstrap as well as the footer, both
 have been customized. I also used a snippets from W3Schools for the dropdown menu, this features as also been customized.

 In the navbar there is a link to each sections, that give a brief description of the section with
 three recommended places to go.
 When the user click on one of the section in dropdown menu, it drop markers to the map with a link to their website.

I have plans to implement a rotating top three every months, as new places open and close fast in the services industry. 
I also have plans to add new sections, possibly Airbnb and local music scene.
### Bug encountered
I have tried to rename the `onClick=myFunction()` with a more explainary name, but it only throw the error of undefined in the console, but work no problem with `myFunction()`. So i ledt the way it is. This is part of the W3School snippet for the dropdown menu.

In my `map.js` i have encountered a bug that if i leave my `[]` empty when defining or iterating it would throw an error in VScode. `Uncaught syntax error unexpected token ']'` and in the Google developer.

I have tried to fix it, i look into google, CI, Slack and Stack everywhere it clearly says we can leaves an empty `[]` , but for some reason, it only works if it's not empty.

### Testing
The sites as been tested using the google chrome Devtol, and on Samsung Galaxy S8,S9, Samsung A8, Ipad Pro, on laptop and on HD 39inch screen. The website is responsive on all platform.
I have manually tested the links to all nine website.

The HTML and CSS have been tested in the W3C validator, the CSS came back no error, and the HTML came back with a warning at line 87 with a lack of heading, but it is not required, it is my map container.

#### Acknowledgements

*I am aware that my `map.js` contain some bad practice of `DRY`, i have tried to rectify it but my knwoledge of Javascript is limited, i did asked for help, and got given many different way to write the section of code i need help with. And rather than submitting an unfinished project, i submitted a non perfectly good practice project, i hope you will undertand.
* I would like to thanks CI for the inpirations on layout and part of the build of the webpage.
* I also make great use of Brad Traversy tutorials on Javascript.
* I would like to thank my mentor Brian Macharia, and everybody at the tutor team and particularly Tim Nelson.
